# Hangman Game (Full-Stack)

This is a **real-time multiplayer Hangman game** built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB Change Streams**, **Socket.IO**, and a **React frontend**.  
Players can join as either:
- A **Riddler** who sets the puzzle, or
- A **Guesser** who attempts to solve it, one letter at a time.

The game state is **persisted in MongoDB**, and **real-time updates** are powered by MongoDB **Change Streams** and **Socket.IO** events.
